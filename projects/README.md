# Projects

This page lists current TAG projects. Working groups can be found in the [working-groups folder](../working-groups/).
The TAG has a number of smaller initiatives that do not require the formation of a working group.
Projects are not only smaller, but also more scoped and have a clear goal to be achieved once the project is completed.

## Starting a project

If you would like to start a project in TAG ENV, you are more than welcome to propose your idea. Please open an [issue](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/issues/new?assignees=&labels=triage-required&projects=&template=suggestion.md&title=%5BSuggestion%2FProposal%5D+some+descriptive+title) and follow the instructions. We are looking forward to your ideas!

## Adding the accepted project details to the repository

Fork the TAG ENV repository and add a new folder with the project name and the starting date of the project in this folder `20XX-project-name`. Inside the folder place a `README.md` with project details as outlined below. If applicable, additional artifacts of the project can be added to the folder.
