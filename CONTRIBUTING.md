Anyone interested in contributing should join the mailing list and other [communication channels](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability#contact)

We strongly encourage and support all our members to participate in anyway they can.

## First time contributors

We happily welcome our new contributors to this community. If you are contributing to the CNCF and/or Environmental Sustainability TAG for the first time it is okay if you feel overwhelmed.
We, as a community, are always there to help you with any problems you are facing.
Open source is about collaboration and we are always there to support each other.

### Quick start

The purpose of this plan is to ensure that you become familiar with the team and know how you will contribute. The first step is to get yourself familiar with our mission at [Environmental Sustainability TAG charter](charter.md).

New members are advised to:

* Join the [CNCF Slack team](https://slack.cncf.io/), particularly
  [#tag-environmental-sustainability](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C03F270PDU6) channel and
  introduce yourself.
* Initially go through the following documents in the repository:
  * [README.md](README.md)
  * [CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
  * [Governance and Processes](governance/README.md)
* Regularly join one of the [Zoom meetings](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability#contact) at least for the first
  couple of months to get yourself up to speed.
* Have a look and participate at our [GH Discussions](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/discussions)
* Here are multiple ways to get involved:
  * Join the meeting as advised above and express your area of interests or if
    you want to work on any specific issue.
  * Express your thoughts or ask questions on an issue you find interesting.
  * Choose a [good first issue](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), [help wanted](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/labels/help%20wanted) and
    comment on it expressing interest.

### Getting involved and contributing

As a new contributor, you might find difficulties in understanding where to start.
Don't worry!
We are here to help you.

In the interest of getting more new people involved, we have issues marked as [good-first-issues](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) and [help wanted](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/labels/help%20wanted).
These are issues that have a smaller scope, and are great to start with.

The good-first-issues should also provide you details on how to get things resolved or how to proceed. If you find it is missing or incomplete please tag the person who created the issue and let them know.
