# Environmetal Sustainability TAG presentations

Part of the TAG activities include having guest presentations by members of the community.
We welcome any topic related to our mission and charter.
Typical topics include projects, real-world use-cases, challenges or success stories.
However, presentations must follow the following guidelines.

- [Environmetal Sustainability TAG presentations](#environmetal-sustainability-tag-presentations)

## Guidelines

- Presentations are encouraged to expose the TAG to cloud native open source projects, cloud native sustainability concepts, and environmental conservation oriented groups.
- Presentations should fit with [our charter](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/blob/main/charter.md)
- Presentations should not be scheduled on the Agenda until the issue is filled in and the TAG representative has performed due diligence on the issue
- Presentations should abide by the CNCF code of conduct

Examples of topics that are within scope:
