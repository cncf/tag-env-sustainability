# Roles within the TAG Environmental Sustainability

The TAG includes several key roles that are critical to the group's success.
The group will have many members, all serving in varying capacities.
Within this document, "member" may refer to a Chair, a Technical Lead, or other Member roles.

Through the high variety of inputs we received during the TAG creation phase and the different perspectives displayed, a member structure similar to a TAG will be suitable.

The following is the current listing of member roles:

* [Chairs](#role-of-chairs)
* [Technical Leads](#role-of-technical-leads)
* [Project Leads](#role-of-project-leads)
* [TAG Representatives](#role-of-tag-representatives)
* [Team leads](#role-of-team-leads)
* [Group Members](#role-of-members)
* [TOC Liaison](#toc-liaison)
* [Facilitation Roles](#facilitation-roles)

Members fulfilling any Roles in TAG are responsible for understanding and abiding the by the governance and policies defined in this group.
This commitment and execution of understanding includes not only commits to the repo, but also to any approvals or direction required by their Role.

## Role of members

* The primary role of a member is to contribute expertise to the group.
* To add yourself as a member, submit a [Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/cncf/people/blob/80529e2dac7b7e00cd385dbec2d3e6c7d04a1cfb/config.yaml#L1083) adding yourself to the list of members. Please put put TAG co-chairs in CC of the PR.

### Maintaining active members

* Members *SHOULD* remain active and responsive in their Roles.
* Members taking an extended leave of 1 or more months *SHOULD* coordinate with other members to ensure the role is adequately staffed during the leave.
* Members going on leave for 1-3 months *MAY* work with other members to identify a temporary replacement.
* Members of a role *SHOULD* remove any other members that have not communicated a leave of absence and either cannot be reached for more than 1 month or are not fulfilling their documented responsibilities for more than 1 month. This may be done through a super-majority vote of members, or if there are not enough *active* members to get a super-majority of votes cast, then removal may occur through a super-majority vote of the Chairs.
* Members contribute to projects, according to the [process](process.md).

### Managing membership

* Membership disagreements may be escalated to the Chairs. Disagreements among the Chairs may be escalated to a Environmental Sustainability TAG TOC Liaison.
* Members *MAY* decide to step down at anytime and optionally propose a replacement.

## Role of chairs

The Chairs serve in administrative roles, guiding the TAG and support the decision taking. However, due to the pure complexity of the TAG topic, the role of the chairs include also the activities of technical leads.

* Primary role of Chairs is to run operations and the governance of the group.
* The Chairs are responsible for ensuring that group meetings are planned and facilitated effectively, while also engaging group members in leadership roles. Effective facilitation includes (but is not limited to) the following activities:
  * setting the agenda for meetings
  * extending discussion via asynchronous communication to be inclusive of members who cannot attend a specific meeting time.
  * scheduling discussion of proposals that have been submitted
  * asking for new proposals to be made to address an identified need
  * partnering with Technical Leads to establish a roadmap and manage ongoing projects

## Role of technical leads

Technical Leads (TLs) expand the bandwidth of the leadership team. Proposals must have a TL or Chair working as an active sponsor (as detailed in [TAG process](process.md)).

The general list of activities for TL are:

* Establish new sub-projects
* Decommission existing sub-projects
* Resolve cross-sub-project technical issues and decisions
* Propose agenda items for meetings to ensure that open issues are discussed with the group when needed

[Environmental Sustainability TAG TL nomination process](tech-lead-proposal-process.md)

## Role of project leads

Project Leads lead specific projects where a deliverable has been defined within the issue.

Project Leads are nominated and approved by the following process:

  1. Project Lead actively participates in the group, initiates the proposal or volunteers to take on a project that has been prioritized by the group
  1. A Chair or TL nominates a candidate, or requests the community to nominate in a slack thread
  1. The issue is updated with the assignment of the project lead as "assignee" alongside the TAG Leadership member.
  1. Project Leads will be given the OWNER role of the directory or sub-directory for their team's activities in order to empower merge/approve.
  
### On-going projects
  
On the occasion where a project becomes long term, Project Leads are also given the OWNER role of the directory or sub-directory along with 1 other nominated individual to ensure continuity in review and ongoing support of the project.

Depending on the expected length of the project, Project Leads may be assigned as OWNERS of the project directory in this repository to help facilitate and moderate new content to the project.

### Duties of a project lead

Project leads are responsible for the following:

- Adhering to the [project process](process.md)
- Proposing and refining the project scope, goal and schedule

## Role of Environmental Sustainability TAG representatives

Environmental Sustainability TAG representatives are leadership executive sponsors of a project.
The TAG representative acts as a point of liaison with the TAG leadership team and takes on a role of mentorship for the project lead(s).

TAG Environmental Sustainability representatives are required to be part of the TAG leadership team.
This includes co-chairs, technical leads and co-chair emeritus roles.
A TAG representative may be of capacity of an individual contributor but cannot be the project lead of the same project they are representing.

Environmental Sustainability TAG representatives are appointed through the following process:

- A member of the leadership indicates that they would like to be a TAG representative on a project by:
  - editing the issue's "TAG Representative" field to their github ID.
  - setting the issue milestone to the corresponding milestone created for their github ID.
- TAG representatives may change based on discretion of co-chairs.

### Duties of a Environmental Sustainability TAG representative

Environmental Sustainability TAG representatives are responsible for the following:

- Reporting back to the leadership on the status of the project, indicating when the project requires external governance help. For example, these include:
  - Project is understaffed or suffers from rampant scope creep.
  - Project is inactive and needs to be discontinued.
  - Inter-personal issues within leads and/or members causing disruption.
- Provide feedback to project lead to whether the current scope and operation of a project is in line with the vision and governance of the TAG.
- Mentorship of project leads on matters of leadership and governance process.
- Provide privilege facilities that a project lead does not have access to.

Examples are:
  - Creating a ServiceNow ticket with the CNCF for design help
  - Uploading of meeting recordings to youtube
  - Approval of messages to TAG mailing list

## TOC liaison

The TOC Liaison for the Environmental Sustainability TAG is nominated by the TOC.
The TAG Chairs are responsible for establishing effective communication with the TOC liaison, including further communication to the wider TOC upon request.

The TOC Liaison will occasionally prioritize TAG activities, as needed by the TOC, to further the [CNCF mission](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#1-mission-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation).

## Facilitation roles

Members often contribute by working in small groups that research and discuss options and then share their findings with the rest of the group in a presentation and typically contribute to the body of work in this repository (via Pull Request).
Some tasks can be effectively executed by simply chiming in on a github issue and independently contributing a PR without any particular role or authorization.

This section describes roles where more coordination is helpful and the work benefits from identifying one or more members who will take on specific responsibilities.
Our goal is to empower members to move forward independently, while defining an approval process designed to support communication and alignment across the wider group.

New roles in this section are typically defined after someone has acted in that role for some time informally, then proposed as an on-going role by Pull Request which must be approved by a majority of Chairs.
Process clarifications are welcome and PRs can be approved by any single Chair.

### Meeting facilitator

In keeping with these goals, the meeting facilitator has the following responsibilities:

* prepares the meeting notes with template and agenda
