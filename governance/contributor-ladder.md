# Contributor Path

The CNCF Environmental Sustainability TAG aims to support individuals who are passionate about cloud native sustainability and provide a space for personal growth as contributors.
This document outlines a path for advancing as a contributor in the TAG. 
It's important to note that your journey may not precisely align with this path, as the document serves as a general guide.
If you have already made significant contributions to another TAG or a project within the CNCF landscape and are familiar with the community, your path will naturally differ from that of someone who is just starting out.

## Starting out

When venturing into the open source space, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with the way we operate and collaborate as a global community.
Take some time to reflect on your personal journey.
Find out if you genuinely derive joy from this line of work and consider what areas of knowledge you are particularly curious about.
Remember, actively participating and providing valuable input are significant aspects of your involvement in the community.
By engaging with others and sharing your insights, you contribute to the collective growth and success of the open source ecosystem.

* Join Community Meetings, the Slack Channel and the mailing list (take a look at [this page](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/#contact)).
* Proactively participate in discussions at community meetings, in Slack threads, or [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/issues).
* Get to know the Group.

## Taking ownership & responsibility

Providing more leadership within the Environmental Sustainability TAG is highly encouraged. Actively participating in discussions and driving ideas and projects forward is crucial for the group's advancement.
Within the [`roles.md`](roles.md) file, you will find various volunteer positions available.
To begin, consider taking ownership of a small initiative within the TAG, such as opening an issue that was discussed during a meeting, or taking on responsibilities like reviewing pull requests (PRs).
Additionally, you can contribute by raising awareness about the TAG ENV among your network. This can involve sharing information and updates, presenting talks at conferences or events, organizing meetups, or even writing a blog post (refer to [blog post process](blogpost-process.md) for guidance).
Collaboration with other organizations is also a priority for us, so actively seeking out open source projects or organizations you know in the cloud native sustainability space and connecting them with the TAG would be highly valuable.
By proactively driving topics that directly benefit the Environmental Sustainability TAG, you significantly contribute to its growth and overall impact and will help you mature as a contributor.

* Proactively start discussions.
* Take ownership of small initiatives.
* Provide help when help is needed or requested (for instance, taking notes or reviewing documents).
* Provide actionable feedback to processes.

## Leading a project

Once you have established connections within the TAG and actively participated in discussions and projects, you may encounter a topic that captures your interest and warrants further attention.
This particular project might require more time and dedication from your side as well as the support of other individuals within the community.
If you have a project idea that aligns with the objectives of the TAG, consider writing a proposal, in a GitHub issue, outlining its motivation, scope, goals, and deliverables.
Present this proposal during a TAG meeting to initiate a discussion and gather feedback and support from fellow members.
Taking on a [project leadership role](roles.md#role-of-project-leads) within the community project becomes your next significant step towards leadership recognition within the group.

* Take ownership of a project within the TAG.
* Lead a community group within the TAG.

## Helping out

In open source, newcomers join the community need guidance and support as they embark on their journey, just as you once did.
While it is essential to provide support to current members and leaders, it is equally important to focus on assisting and orienting newcomers.
Modeling empathy and offering support to the community as a whole should be at the forefront of your actions.
It is crucial to role model the values of the community as outlined in the [code of conduct](http://cncf.io/conduct/).

There are various ways you can contribute to supporting and empowering new contributors.
You can actively participate by offering mentorship and guidance when someone requests assistance. This could involve helping them navigate the community, providing technical guidance, or answering their questions.
Additionally, if a member is unable to fulfill their responsibilities, you can offer to fill in their role temporarily or assist in any necessary tasks.
Co-hosting meetups and events is another way to provide support. By sharing the responsibility, you help create an inclusive environment where everyone feels supported and encouraged.

Building a brand of being someone who consistently helps is highly valuable.
Actions to help this include engaging in discussions, providing feedback on proposals, reviewing code contributions, and offering assistance in any way that aligns with your skills and expertise.
By actively participating and contributing, you demonstrate your commitment to the community and showcase the values that the Environmental Sustainability TAG holds dear.

* Helping out and mentor new contributors in their open source journey.
* Helping out community members and leaders if they need support.
* Demonstrating empathy and embody the community values.

## Leading a Working Group

Since leadership roles naturally change over time, it is worth your while to take a leadership position in an established working group.
Within the TAG for Environmental Sustainability, dedicated working groups carry out several ongoing initiatives.
However, if the current working groups do not provide space for the topic you are interested in, you could start a new working group.
A working group must have community support and requires that you find sufficient backing before a working group is formed.
To start this process, create a GitHub issue describing the initial charter in which you outline the motivation, scope, goals, and deliverables of the proposed working group.
This working group charter document should form the basis for discussions with the TAG before initiating an official vote by the TAG co-chairs, which also requires approval by the CNCF TOC.
It is important to present the working group proposal during TAG meetings and be vocal about the discussions, actively solicit feedback and input, and gain support from other members.

* Taking on more responsibility and ownership within TAG.
* Leading a community group within TAG.
* Good at negotiating with differing opinions.
