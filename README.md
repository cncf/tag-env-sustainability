# TAG Environmental Sustainability 🌳🌍♻️

## Introduction

Welcome to the Environmental Sustainability Technical Advisory Group. This TAG works with the open source community to define environmental sustainability factors for the cloud native landscape, incubate and advocate open source projects to observe and measure Cloud Native infrastructure carbon footprint, optimize and eventually reduce carbon footprint and promote Cloud Native infrastructure to combat environmental challenges.

We want to raise awareness of environmental sustainability as a key element of open source development and support projects which foster an understanding of energy drivers.
All activities should positively impact the community by changing mindset, increasing efficiency, and putting sustainability on everyone's agenda.

## Project List

Currently there is no dedicated section on the CNCF landscape that lists projects in the sustainability category, but you can check our [Landscape Document](https://tag-env-sustainability.cncf.io/landscape) for more information about projects in the cloud native and open source space that are making an impact in the area of cloud native environmental sustainability.
