The Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s flagship conference gathers adopters and technologists from leading open source and cloud native communities in Paris, France from 19-22 March 2024.

The TAG will also be running a few things in Paris!

## TAG TAG Booth

TAG members will be at our booth on the AM of Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday! Find us at Solutions Showcase | Level 7.2 | Hall 7.2 | Project Pavilion Booth #PP20-B! Come and chat to us about the work we are currently doing, different projects and working groups, or how you can get involved!

## TAG Meetup

We are currently planning a meet up in a TBD time and location!

## TAG [Talk](https://sched.co/1Yhgd)

In tech, sustainability is not just an ideal but a pressing technical challenge, especially within the domain of cloud computing. Enter the CNCF Technical Advisory Group for Environmental Sustainability (TAG ENV), a community group dedicated to cultivating a more eco-friendly CNCF landscape. Join us as we navigate the key challenges confronting our community in the pursuit of a more environmentally friendly cloud native ecosystem. We'll shed light on TAG ENV's latest initiatives and achievements, like our ongoing assessment of the sustainability footprint of CNCF projects. By the end of this session, you'll grasp the current landscape of cloud native sustainability and gain insights into the community's efforts to enhance it. Discover practical ways our work can benefit you and your company, and learn how to actively contribute to our endeavors. Most importantly, you'll recognize sustainability not just as a concept but as an urgent technical challenge demanding attention.
