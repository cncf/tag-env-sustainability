## C

### **Carbon or Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**

Carbon Dioxide commonly just named carbon is a colorless, odorless gas, that is released from burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas.
CO2 emissions are fundamentally a natural process, but one that has been exacerbated by the burning of natural resources for energy production or logistics to such an extent that it is now a major factor in climate change. Depending on how the supply chain of hardware (e.g. computer chips, cables etc.) and software (e.g. digital services like cloud computing, file sharing etc.) production/services is structured, CO2 gets emitted.

### **Carbon Diet**

Actions to reduce the output of CO2 to reduce the impact on the environment.

### **Carbon Footprint**

Is the total amount of greenhouse gasses, often carbon dioxide, that a person, family, company, organization, or building (like a data center) releases to the environment.
This includes the release of GHG through direct use (e.g. the energy consumption of a data center) and indirect use (e.g. the energy required to produce servers).

### **Climate or Carbon Neutrality**

Often used by organizations and companies to express that they equalize the cause of carbon pollution they generate.
This typically happens by buying negative carbon emissions from organizations that really saved carbon or are net-zero or even reduce more carbon than they produce.
However, it is important to understand that this is only a compensation and does not have to imply a new product development leading to more sustainability. Please also read about the term "Net Zero" as both terms are often mixed or misleadingly used.

### **Carbon-Aware Scheduling**
A method of optimizing workload execution times based on the carbon intensity of the energy grid. By scheduling tasks during periods when renewable energy sources are more prevalent, this approach aims to reduce the carbon footprint of computing operations.

### **Cloud Native Sustainability**
An approach that integrates sustainability principles into cloud-native technologies. It involves building and operating applications that are scalable and resilient while also being energy-efficient and environmentally responsible throughout their lifecycle.

### **Carbon Transparency**
The ability to measure and communicate the carbon emissions associated with specific cloud workloads or software services. It often includes automated tooling and reporting, helping developers and users make more informed decisions about sustainability trade-offs.

### **Carbon-Aware Kubernetes**
A Kubernetes scheduling strategy or extension that considers the carbon intensity of the electricity powering different clusters or nodes. It allows workloads to be directed toward regions or times with cleaner energy availability, enabling more sustainable cloud-native operations.

## E

### **Eco-Efficiency**

Goods and services that use fewer resources and create less waste and pollution.

### **Embodied (Carbon) Emissions**

Embodied (sometimes substituted with the word Embedded) Carbon Emissions are all emissions caused during a good's production.
That can include anything from transportation, storage, heating, the production of other goods to finish this good and so on.

### **Emissions**

This is an umbrella term that usually is used to refer to gasses, but can also include other factors such as micro-particles. Emissions are categorized into three scopes:
Scope 1: direct emissions: for example the CO2 output of the vehicles owned by the company
Scope 2: indirect emissions: for example the power consumption of a data center, that causes emissions by the production of electricity
Scope 3: indirect emissions, that not directly can be changed: for example delivery chain caused CO2 pollution

### **Environmental Sustainability**

Sustainability is the concept of a social, economical and environmental activity that, in simple terms, leaves the ecosystem as it found it.
Environmental sustainability focuses on the ecological impact of our doings and how we can improve our actions to reduce or eliminate our negative impact on nature, earth, and finally humanity.

## G

### **Green House Gas (GHG)**

Any kind of gasses caused by nature or human activities that trap heat in the atmosphere. GHG includes carbon dioxide, methane, ozone and others.
These gasses are called greenhouse gas because they have the same effect as a greenhouse: the sunlight can enter the house and part is reflected back, but it canâ€˜t leave the greenhouse fully because the roof prevents the heat from escaping.
This causes the inside of a greenhouse to get hotter and hotter, the same as what is going on with the earth. See also: Emissions.

### **Green Software**
Software designed and developed with energy efficiency and environmental impact in mind. This includes optimizing code to consume fewer resources, reducing unnecessary computations, and ensuring that applications run efficiently on hardware to minimize energy use.

### **Green Reviews**
Evaluations conducted to assess the environmental impact of software projects or infrastructure. These reviews aim to identify areas where energy consumption can be reduced and sustainability can be improved within the development and deployment processes.

## N

### **Net Zero**

This phrase stands for zero-carbon emissions, in that anyone (including companies) using this term must store or neutralize the same amount of carbon as that consumed.

## O

### **Operational Carbon Emission**

This refers to the quantity of carbon emitted during the phase where something is in use. Typical examples are when buildings like data centers are in use, or (if measurable) this may also refer to smaller elements in that datacenter, such as when a server is powered on.
Per definition, operational carbon emissions include the usage, management and maintenance.

## P

### **Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)**

The PUE describes how efficiently a data center uses energy. It defines how much energy is used by the computing equipment vs the overall power consumption of the data center.
An ideal PUE is 1.0. It is also a global standard under the ISO/IEC 30134-2:2016.

PUE is calculated either through:
Total Facility Energy / IT Equipment Energy
1 + Non-IT Facility Energy / IT Equipment Energy

### **Power-Aware Scheduling**
A strategy that involves scheduling computing tasks based on the power consumption characteristics of hardware and the availability of energy resources. The goal is to optimize energy usage and reduce environmental impact without compromising performance.

## S

### **Server Idle Energy Coefficiency (SIEC)**

Developed by the research project LEAP and is done by measuring the server energy consumption. What is relevant here is the continuous energy consumption of the server VS. the actually required energy by the chip.
This mainly depends on the configuration or modus of the server power management. Very simplified, it's the SIEC calculated by the energy wasted during idle time decided by the energy consumption in total.
The higher the number (given as %) the worse it is.

### **Sustainable Computing**
The practice of designing, manufacturing, using, and disposing of computers and associated subsystems efficiently and effectively with minimal impact on the environment. This encompasses energy-efficient hardware, resource-optimized software, and responsible end-of-life disposal.

## Abbreviations

GHG - Green House Gas

PUE - Power Usage Effectiveness

SIEC - Server Idle Energy Coefficiency
