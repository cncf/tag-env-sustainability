## Meetings

1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month at 16:00 UTC ([convert to your local
time](https://dateful.com/convert/utc?t=16)).

Meetings are listed on the [main CNCF calendar](https://www.cncf.io/calendar/)
as well as the [TAG ENV Calendar](https://tockify.com/cncf.public.events/monthly?search=TAG%20Environmental%20Sustainability).

You can add working group meeting series to your calendar in two ways.

The first way is to import the TAG Environmental Sustainability CNCF calendar feed into your calendar from following URL: [https://icalfilter.com/j9732u68l2](https://icalfilter.com/j9732u68l2). Here's a guide for how to do it in Google Calendar: [Subscribe to someone’s Google Calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37100?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop). In this case your calendar will be automatically updated once new events are published.

The second way is to download the .ics file by navigating directly to the following URL: [https://icalfilter.com/j9732u68l2](https://icalfilter.com/j9732u68l2). In this case no automatic updates are supported.
