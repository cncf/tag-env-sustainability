## Tech meets green: sustainable IT solutions for the future

**Sustainability**, while a broad societal concept, has gained traction in the IT sector, prompting us to reconsider our practices. The IT sector has a significant environmental footprint due to its widespread use. By supporting renewable energy-driven cloud services and promoting effective electronic recycling, we can direct the IT industry towards a more sustainable path. The **CNCF TAG Environmental Sustainability (TAG ENV)** was formed as a technical advisory group to address some of these challenges, with a focus on the cloud native realm. The **CNCF Cloud Native Sustainability Week** emerged as a TAG ENV project, bringing the community together to spotlight the need for a more sustainable approach to cloud native application development.

At the heart of this event is the TAG ENV, **focusing on reducing the environmental impact of the cloud native technologies**, while also emphasizing the importance of measuring and enhancing the IT sector's sustainability footprint. Cloud native applications, emblematic of this concern, are deployed in data centers and consume substantial energy resources.

Being an integral part of the CNCF, **the TAG ENV has the unique opportunity to directly influence and enhance the sustainability posture of the projects within the CNCF** landscape, thereby directly impacting software being deployed across a multitude of industries and systems.  

## Digital age: global gatherings for sustainability

The **CNCF Sustainability Week** is an event that combines **in-person** meetups with virtual sessions, allowing participants from all over the world to join, learn, and collaborate regardless of their geographical location.

**In-person** events are hosted by CNCF community groups in cities across the globe, showcasing the worldwide commitment to sustainability. These gatherings provide the unique opportunity to directly interact with industry experts, share experiences, and build personal relationships with other professionals with a shared interest in sustainability in the cloud native world. Attending a local event allows for a deep understanding of specific regional challenges and solutions.

On the other hand, **virtual events** offer flexibility and accessibility. Primarily organized by the CNCF Environmental Sustainability Technical Advisory Group (TAG ENV), these webinars and online sessions allow anyone to participate, regardless of their location. These events highlight the latest research, trends, and solutions in the field of cloud native sustainability and represent a crucial opportunity for global learning and collaboration.

Regardless of the chosen format, whether it's an in-person event or a virtual session, each event is designed to promote knowledge sharing and inspire concrete actions towards greater sustainability in the cloud native space.
